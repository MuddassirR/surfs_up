## Overview of Analysis
The broad goal of the data analysis was to determine if an entrepreneur should operate a surfing & ice cream shop in Huwaii based on weather analysis. The entrepreneuer hired an investor who asked us to check temperature trends before opening up a shop. Speicifically, he/she asked us to check and analyze temperature data for the months of June and December to determine if the shop is sustainable year-round.
